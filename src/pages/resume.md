## About me

- I am software engineer from Ethiopia. I started coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript many years ago and fell in love with it. That's why I decided to study software engineering at [AAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa_University). I enjoy my career very much and I always welcome new challenges and opportunities to learn.

- Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with:

        {label: 'Others', value: 'Others'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="Frontend">
