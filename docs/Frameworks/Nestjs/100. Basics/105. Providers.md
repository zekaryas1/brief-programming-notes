# 105. Providers

## Services Vs Providers

- Providers
	- **Providers are responsible for defining and managing dependencies within the application.**
	- Providers are a broad category of components in Nest.js that encompass various types of injectable objects.
- Standard Providers or **Services**:  
	- Services are a specific type of provider in Nest.js that encapsulate the business logic of the application.
	- Services are often used to handle complex operations, data manipulation, or any other application-specific functionality.

> All services are providers, but not all providers are services.

# Type of Providers

- Doc
	- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#non-class-based-provider-tokens)
- Standard Providers(Services)
- Value based providers
- Non class based providers
- Class based providers
- Factory providers

## Standard Providers

- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#standard-providers)

```ts
//in nest
providers: [
	CoffeeService
]

//is equivalent to
providers: [
	{
		provider: CoffeSerivce,  //<---token
		useClass: CoffeSerivce   //<---class
	}
]

//the former is just a shorthand form of the latter
```

## Value Based Provides - useValue

- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#value-providers-usevalue)
- using useValue based providers, we can make nest provide the provider we want(object, json, arrayâ€¦) with specific token
- in the following example we can see for token called `CoffeeService` we will be injecting `MockCoffeeService`
	- *this can be very useful for testing*

```ts
class MockCoffeeService {}

@Module({
  controllers: [CoffesController],
  providers: [
	  {
		  provide: CoffesService, 
		  useValue: new MockCoffeeService()
		}
	]
})
export class CoffesModule {}

```

## Non Class Based Providers

- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#non-class-based-provider-tokens)
- in-addition to providing a class as a provider, we can use any type of object with string token
- key things to remember
	- provider => token(key) -> which can be string, classRef, or variableRef
	- useValue => value -> which can be class, array, string or any value.

```ts
class MockCoffeeService {}

@Module({
  controllers: [CoffesController],
  providers: [
	  {
		  provide: 'COFEE_BRANDS', 
		  useValue: ['A', 'B', 'C']
		}
	],
})
export class CoffesModule {}
```

```ts
//to use the coffe_brand
constructor(
	@Inject('COFEE_BRANDS')
	private coffeeBrand: string[]
)
```

## Class Based Providers - useClass

- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#class-providers-useclass)
- in-addition to useValue, using nest architecture use can provide calculated value using useClass
	- *this is what is used by the default nest architecture*

```ts
class MockCoffeeService {}

@Module({
  controllers: [CoffesController],
  providers: [
    { 
		provide:  CoffeeService, 
		useClass: process.env == 'DEV' ? MockCoffeeService : CoffeeSerivce		
	}
  ],
  exports: [CoffesService]
})
export class CoffesModule {}
```

## Factory Provider - useFactory

- [Custom providers | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory)
- this provider helps use other providers and create a single provider to use.
- it is to possible to use `async` functions with factory provider, this way all class using(injecting) this factory provider will wait until the operation completed

```ts
@Injectable()
export class CoffeeBrandsFactory{

	create(){
		return ['A', 'B'];
	}
}

providers: [
	{
		provide: 'COFFEE_BRAND',
		useFactory: (brandFactory: CoffeeBrandsFactory) => brandFactory.create(),  //provide the final value
		inject: [CoffeeBrandsFactory]  //..inject another factory service
	}
]
```

```ts
providers: [
	{
		provide: 'COFFEE_BRAND',
		useFactory: async (con: Connection) => {
			return await conn.runQuery('SELECT *...')
		},  //provide the final value
		inject: [Connection]  //..inject another factory service
	}
]
```
