# 100. Basics

## Intro

- [Nest.Js official introduction](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
	- Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
	- It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript.
- Nest.js is configurable
	- ex: by default uses express but can work with fastify http server
- you can use nest.js to mainly build
	- rest.api
	- micro-services
	- web sockets
	- and graphQL
- nest cli
	- nest has a cli, that you can use to create, run nest projects
	- can be used to create files
	- run `nest --help` for more.
- Nest Building Blocks
	- nest has many building blocks that serve specific purposes and play a crucial role in the overall architecture of an application,
	- Fundamentals building blocks
		- [Controllers](Frameworks/Nestjs/100.%20Basics/102.%20Controllers.md)
		- [Modules](Frameworks/Nestjs/100.%20Basics/103.%20Modules.md)
		- [Services](Frameworks/Nestjs/100.%20Basics/104.%20Services.md)
		- [Providers](Frameworks/Nestjs/100.%20Basics/105.%20Providers.md)
	- [More Building Blocks](Frameworks/Nestjs/400.%20More%20Building%20Blocks.md)
		- Exception filters
		- Guards
		- Pipes
		- Interceptors
		- `Middlewares`
		- …

## Nest CLI

### Build & Run

- [Installation](https://docs.nestjs.com/#installation)

```sh
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project-name

cd project-name
npm run start
```

- nest has development mode
	- reloads on file changes
	- automatic re-build

```sh
npm run start:dev

# To speed up the development process (x20 times faster builds), you can use the SWC builder by passing the -b swc flag to the start script, as follows npm 
npm run start -- -b swc
```

### File Generation

- Generating nest building blocks(modules, components, services…)

```sh
nest g co component-name

#with not test
nest g co componet-name --no-spec

nest g mo module-name

nest g s service-name
```

### Crud Generator

- [CRUD generator | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/crud-generator#crud-generator)
- When working on a new feature i.e Product, instead of creating each nest building blocks, you can use `nest g resource`.
- nest g resource command not only generates all the NestJS building blocks (module, service, controller classes) but also an entity class, DTO classes as well as the testing (.spec) files.

```sh
nest g resource resource-name

#ex:
nest g resource users

nest g resource users --no-spec #to avoid test files
```

> nest crud generator also works for graphql and microservice projects

## Folder Structure

- In Nest.js, there isn't a strict folder structure that you must adhere to. However, it's common to follow a modular approach when organizing your codebase, especially for larger projects. Here's a suggested folder structure for a "users" feature:

```
src/
└── users/
    ├── dto/
    │   ├── create-user.dto.ts
    │   └── update-user.dto.ts
    ├── entities/
    │   └── user.entity.ts
    ├── controllers/
    │   └── users.controller.ts
    ├── services/
    │   └── users.service.ts
    ├── modules/
    │   └── users.module.ts
```
