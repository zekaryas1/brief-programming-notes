# 600. Testing with Jest

- [Testing | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing)
- In nest, you can use any testing framework that you like, as Nest doesn't force any specific tooling.

## Unit Testing with Jest

### Installation

```bash
npm i --save-dev @nestjs/testing
```

### Run Test Commands

```sh
npm run test   # for unit tests
npm run test:cov  # for test coverage
npm run test:e2e  # for e2e tests

npm run test:watch -- coffees.service # run specific sile in watch mode
```

- test files end with [name].spec.ts
	- coffee.controller.spec.ts
	- coffee.service.spec.ts
- write tests as self-explanatory code, check the following example
	- [Testing | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing#unit-testing)

```ts
describe('findOne', () => {
	describe('when user exists', () => {
	  it('should return user', () => {
		expect(appController.findOne(1)).toEqual({
		  id: 1,
		  name: 'user1',
		});
	  });
	});
	
	describe('when user does not exist', () => {
	  it('should return null', () => {
		expect(appController.findOne(2)).toBeNull();
	  });
	})
})
```

- close app after running e2e tests
	- nest will give you warning about `Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed`
	- to fix this
		- add an `afterAll` jest method to close the app
		- change `beforeEach` to `beforeAll`, we don't want to recreate the whole app in `e2e` tests for each test

```ts
beforeAll(async () => {
	await app.init();
})
 
//tests...

afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
})
```

- npm has a pre-built in option, to make commands run before and after a certain command is executed
	- for example: we can create a test db before running a test and remote the test db after running the test, just using npm
	- to do this, add `pre[npmcommand]`, or/and `post[npmcommand]`

```json
"pretest:e2e": "docker compose up -d test-db",
"test:e2e": "jest ...",
"posttest:e2e": "docker compose stop test-dp && docker compose rm -f test-db"
```

## HTTP Testing with Supertest

- [Testing | NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing#end-to-end-testing)
- Keep your e2e test files inside the test directory. The testing files should have a `.e2e-spec` suffix.
	- `coffee.service.e2e-spec.ts`

```typescript
  it(`/GET cats`, () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .get('/cats')
      .expect(200)
      .expect({
        data: catsService.findAll(),
      });
  });
```
