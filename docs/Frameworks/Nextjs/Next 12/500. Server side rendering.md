# 500. Server Side Rendering

## Revision on SSG

- With static site generation
	- HTML is statically generated at build time, the built page is then cached and reused for each request.
		- For a dynamic page with `getStaticPaths` and fallback set to true the page is not generated at build time but is generated on the initial request.
		- With incremental static re-generation, a page an be re-generated for a request after the re-validation time has elapsed.
	- Problem with static site generation
		- We cannot fetch data at request time
			- With not being able to fetch data per request (always), we run into the problem of stale data
		- We don't get access to the incoming request
			- Problem when the data that needs to be fetched is specific to a user
			- ex: YouTube home page, every-time you reload it will display a unique personalized pages

## SSR

- Nextjs allows you to pre-render a page not at build time but at request time
	- The HTML is generated on each request.
- slower and not-recommended by next.js
	- only use when it is absolutely necessary
- no HTML is generated when building the app, only `js`
	- HTML is generated on each request

### getServeSideProps

- runs only on the server side
	- not included in `js` that is shipped to browser
- you can run server side codes here
- only allowed to be used inside pages, not components
- should return an object containing a props key which is an object
- run at request time

```jsx
function Products({products}) {
    const productUI = (product) => {
        return (<>
            <h2>{product.title}</h2>
            <p>{product.description}</p>
        </>)
    }

    return (<>
        <h2>Your list of products are</h2>
        {
            products.map(productUI)
        }
    </>)
}

export default Products;

export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const response = await fetch("https://dummyjson.com/products");
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
        props: {
            products: data.products
        }
    }
}
```

### SSR with Dynamic Parameters

```jsx
function ProductByCategory({category, products}) {
    return (<>
        <h2> showing products for {category} </h2>
        {
            products.map(product => {
                return <div>
                    <h3>{product.title}</h3>
                    <p>{product.category}</p>
                    <p>{product.id}</p>
                    <hr/>
                </div>
            })
        }
    </>)
}

export default ProductByCategory;


export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const {params} = context;
    const {category} = params;
    const response = await fetch(`https://dummyjson.com/products/category/${category}`);
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
        props: {
            products: data.products,
            category: params.category,
        }
    }
}
```

### getServerSideProps Context

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const {params, req, res, query} = context;

    //can change cookie
    res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", ['name=Zekaryas'])
    
    //get all query {query: mapping}
    console.log(query);

	//get all params
	console.log(params)
}
```

- [get-server-side-props](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
- The context parameter is an object containing the following keys:
	- params
		- if this page uses a dynamic route, params contains the route parameters. If the page name is [id].js , then params will look like { id:…}.
	- req
		- The HTTP IncomingMessage object, with an additional cookies prop, which is an object with string keys mapping to string values of cookies.
	- res
		- The HTTP response object.
	- query
		- An object representing the query string, including dynamic route parameters.
	- …
