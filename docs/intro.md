# How to Become an Expert

- Find a topic to master
	- ex: Problem solving(Algo & DS), Cooking, Chess…
- Regular Practice
	- Find a good resource, this can be {teacher, book, website}
		- ex: Use `Leetcode`, YouTube, competition…
- Get feedback
	- Is the work right or wrong?
	- How good or bad is it…can it be better?
		- can it be refactored?
	- Compare with other solutions
- Make your next step challenging or new
	- Doing the same things multiple times won't make you an expert
		- Previously practicing medium tasks, next should be hard tasks
		- Ex: for coding
			- Now array questions next should be graph problems
			- Not great on DP questions then more practice on DP questions
- Keep challenging yourself or Go back to Step one(Find another topic to master)
