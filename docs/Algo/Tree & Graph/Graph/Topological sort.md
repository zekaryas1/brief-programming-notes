- Topological sort algorithm can find a topological ordering in O(V+E)
- A graph with a cycle can not have a valid ordering
	- only works on as-cyclic directed graph(no cycle)
- Topological sort is not unique, there can be multiple ordering.
- Real world application
	- Course scheduling
	- Program dependencies think `npm` libraries
	- During program compilation

## Topological Ordering of a Tree

> Ordering of a tree is basically a reverse BFS/level-search….starting from leaf nodes and going up.

## Topological Sort Algorithm DFS Version

- Pick an un-visited node
- Do DFS on starting with node…visit only un-visited nodes
- On the recursive callback of the DFS. add the current node to the topological ordering in reverse order.

```python
def topsort(graph):

	N = graph.numberOfNodes()
	V = [False]*N
	ordering = [0]*N
	i = N - 1

	for at in range(N):
		if V[at] == False:
			i = dfs(i, at, V, ordering, graph)

	return ordering

def dfs(i, at, V, ordering, graph):
	V[at] = True

	edges = graph.getEdgesOf(at)

	for edge in edges:
		if V[edge.to] == False:
			i = dfs(i, edge.to, V, ordering, graph)

	ordering[i] = at
	return i - 1
```
