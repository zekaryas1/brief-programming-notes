# 130. Surrounded Regions

## DFS Solution

- The trick to get to the solution is to think reverse.
	- The only regions that will be changed to X are Os that are at the border and other Os that are 4-directionally connected to them.
	- Our solution will have two parts
		- find all the Os that are at the border and all the other Os connected to them
			- we will mark/flag them with \*
			- we can use DFS to do this
		- one the second part all the Os that haven't been marked will have to be changed to X
			- also change \* back to O

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        R,C = len(board), len(board[0])
        
        def DFS(r,c):
            if r < 0 or c < 0:
                return
            if r >= R or c >= C:
                return
            if board[r][c] != 'O':
                return
            
            board[r][c] = '*' #flag Os and all related
            DFS(r+1,c)
            DFS(r-1,c)
            DFS(r,c+1)
            DFS(r,c-1)
        
        
        for r in range(R):
            for c in range(C):
	            #Run DFS for Os at a border
                if board[r][c] == 'O' and (r in [0,R-1] or c in [0, C-1]):
                    DFS(r,c)

		#Canage O -> X and, * -> O
        for r in range(R):
            for c in range(C):
                curr = board[r][c]
                if curr == '*':
                    board[r][c] = 'O'
                elif curr == 'O':
                    board[r][c] = 'X'
                    
        
```

## BFS Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
    if not board:
      return

    m = len(board)
    n = len(board[0])
    dirs = [0, 1, 0, -1, 0]
    q = deque()

    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if i * j == 0 or i == m - 1 or j == n - 1:
          if board[i][j] == 'O':
            q.append((i, j))
            board[i][j] = '*'

    # Mark grids that stretch from four sides with '*'
    while q:
      i, j = q.popleft()
      for k in range(4):
        x = i + dirs[k]
        y = j + dirs[k + 1]
        if x < 0 or x == m or y < 0 or y == n:
          continue
        if board[x][y] != 'O':
          continue
        q.append((x, y))
        board[x][y] = '*'

    for row in board:
      for i, c in enumerate(row):
        row[i] = 'O' if c == '*' else 'X'
```
