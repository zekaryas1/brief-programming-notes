# 146. LRU Cache

## Solution

- The required operations are
	- `get`
		- find the element in the cache and return the value
		- this operation will make the element `most recent element`
	- `put`
		- add element to cache, making it the `most recent element`
		- after adding if the cache capacity is exceed we need to remove `least recent element`
	- based on the above two main operations we also have two more operations
		- remove `least recent element`
		- update/make element `most recent element`
	- all operations must be O(1)
- approach
	- intuitively we can think of `dictionary` to store elements with key, value pair
	- how can we keep track of elements frequency
		- we can use heap{min, max} but that will not be O(1)
		- Think of a linear data-structure with two ends{head, tail}
			- head == `least recent element`
			- tail == `most recent element`
			- with adding and removing from edges with O(1) time complexity
				- when an element is added or accessed it will be moved to the `tail`
					- ==**elements with most frequency will be in front**==
				- when a capacity is full we will remove from `head`
			- The data-structure is ==doubly linked list==,
			- singly linked list wouldn't work because we want a DS, where
				- removing from head and adding to tail to be O(1)

```python
#node for doubly linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.memo = {}
        self.capacity = capacity

		#we will be using sentinal nodes for head and tail
        self.head,self.tail = Node(0,0), Node(0,0)

		#connect the head and tail initially 
        self.head.next, self.tail.prev = self.tail, self.head
    
    # remove node from double linked list
    def remove(self,node):
        prev, nxt = node.prev, node.next
        prev.next, nxt.prev = nxt, prev
    
    #insert at the front = tail
    def insert(self, node):
        prev, nxt = self.tail.prev, self.tail
        
        prev.next, nxt.prev = node, node
        node.prev, node.next = prev, nxt
        
        
    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.memo:
            node = self.memo[key]

			#remove wherever the node is
            self.remove(node)

			#add the node before tail
            self.insert(node)
            return self.memo[key].value
        
        return -1
        

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:

		#remove the node wherever it is
        if key in self.memo:
            node = self.memo[key]
            self.remove(node)
        #add the node before tail
        self.memo[key] = Node(key,value)
        self.insert(self.memo[key])
        
        if len(self.memo) > self.capacity:
		    #if the capacity has been reached remove the head node{LRU}
            node = self.head.next
            self.remove(node)
            del self.memo[node.key]
```
