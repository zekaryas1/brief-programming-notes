title: What is Linked List

# What is Linked List

* A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
	* In a singly linked list. each node points to the next node in the linked list.

	* A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.

* Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list.
	* This means that if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements.
* The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time. For specific applications, this can be useful.

## The Runner Technique

- aka *fast/slow pointers*
	- aka `floyd's tortoise and hare`
- The "runner" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems.
- The runner technique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other.
- The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that the "slow" node iterates through.

```python
#example finding a middle node in linked-list
def middleNode(head):
	slow, fast =  head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

## Tips on Linked List

  * In python and other object is pass by reference
  * Thus when you copy object the changes will be reflected on the original
  * Usually you donâ€™t want this, thus you need to shallow copy such as
	  * newNode = Node(oldNode.value)
