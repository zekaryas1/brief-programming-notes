# How to Act During Interviews

>  Foremost, During each step explain what you’re doing, every step.

1. Make Sure You Understand the Question.
	- Explain the question back to the interviewer
		- …this will help you understand the question better
1. Create Test Cases Input and Output Tests.
	- Write all possible inputs and proper outputs, you can ask the interviewer
		- None, valid, invalid …etc.
	- Write the test cases in the main function as TDD
2. List All the Possible ways/algorithms You Think Will Solve the Problem
	- Start with brute force
	- Select other ex: Binary search, DB, two pointers…
	- [Which algo to select, pattern based answer](Algo/Fundamental%20Algorithms/Recommendations/Which%20algo%20to%20select,%20pattern%20based%20answer.md)
	- Discuss time complexity analysis
	- Select the best/easy based on time/space complexity.
3. Draw/Visualize Your solution(approach)
4. Code with Pseudo-code Before Going to Actual Solution
	- Skip if time is ticking…{you don't want to over explain things}
5. Write the Actual Code
6. Finally, Run the Test Cases
