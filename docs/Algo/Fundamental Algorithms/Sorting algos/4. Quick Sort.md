title: Quick Sort
---

# Quick Sort

- Runtime: 0 (n Log (n)) Average, 0 (n*2) Worst Case. Memory: 0 (log (n) ) .
- In quick sort, we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than the partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it.
- The partitioning can be performed efficiently through a series of swaps.

- If we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an element, the array will eventually become sorted.
- However, as the partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median (or anywhere near the median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the reason for the 0 (n\**2) worst case runtime.

```python
def quickSort(Array):
	return divide(Array)

def divide(Array):
    if len(Array) <= 1:
	    return Array
    else:
        pivote = Array[0]
        left = divide([elt for elt in Array if elt < pivote])
        right = divide([elt for elt in Array if elt > pivote])
        array = concure(Array, left, pivote, right)
        return array

def concure(Array, left, pivote, right):
    return left + [pivote] + right

print(quickSort([6,5,4,3,2,1]))
```
