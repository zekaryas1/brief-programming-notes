title: What is Recursion

# What is Recursion

- Recursion is a process for solving problems by subdividing a larger problem into smaller cases of the problem itself and then solving the smaller, more trivial parts.
- An algorithm can be implemented recursively if it can be expressed in smaller version of itself.

## Factorial

* The factorial of a positive integer n can be used to calculate the number of permutations of n elements. The function is defined as
	* n! = n  * (n -1) * (n2) *â€¦*1
	* 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1

```python
def factorial(n):
	if n==1:
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial(n-1)
print(factorial(6))
```  

## Fibonacci

* The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integer values in which the first two values are both 1 and each subsequent value is the sum of the two previous values. The first 11 terms of the sequence are..
	* 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; 89; : : :
	* The nth Fibonacci number can be computed as follow

```python
def fibo(n):
	if n <= 2:
		return 1
	else:
		return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-1)
print(fibo(5))
```  

## Types of Recursion

* Linear
	* One function call
	* Have a linear recursion trace.
* Binary
	* Two function call
	* Have binary tree recursion trace
* Multiple
	* Multiple function call

## Recursive Runtime

* When you have a recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often (but not always) look like O( branches ** depth ), where branches is the number of times each recursive call branches.
	* For example Fibonacci ( return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))
	* Has a runtime of 2**N (since two branch)
