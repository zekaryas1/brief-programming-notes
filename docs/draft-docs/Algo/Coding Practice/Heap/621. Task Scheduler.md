# 621. Task Scheduler

- Subsequent to [Topological Sort Kahns Algorithm](public-docs/Algo/Tree%20&%20Graph/Graph/Topological%20Sort%20Kahns%20Algorithm.md)
- key things to note
	- every task takes one unit of time
	- the goal is to minimize the idle time
- intuition
	- count the tasks we have in the list
		- ex: `A:3, B:2`
	- be greedy and always process the maximum tasks first
		- for this we can use the [Priority Queue 2 (Heapq)](public-docs/Algo/Fundamental%20Algorithms/Linked%20List/Stack%20&%20Queue.md#Priority%20Queue%202%20(Heapq)) data structure
	- the key thing is, after processing a task, when should you process it next?
		- let's say the current time is 1 (just starting), and the idle time is 2
			- the answers is current time + idle time = 3 (when time is four), *check the code below*
		- to do this(*pseudo code*)
			- start processing from the heap, pop the max task
			- after processing, if the number of tasks left isn't zero, schedule it for latter using either queue or hash-map, I will be using hash-map
				- store on the hash map, `map[current_time+idle_time].add(number of tasks left)`
				- number of tasks left = last number of tasks - 1
			- check is with the current time, whether there are tasks schedule
				- if yes add them to heap, and delete from hash-map
			- the program stops when there are no more tasks left in either heap or hash-map

```
n = 2
tasks = A -> 
time  = 1 ->

#next time we can process task A is [n + t = 3]
tasks = A -> B -> A
time  = 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

## Solution

### Hash-map Version

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        
        counts = Counter(tasks)
        
        mh = [-count for count in counts.values()]
        heapq.heapify(mh)
        
        memo = defaultdict(list)
        time = 0
        
        while mh or memo:
            time += 1
            
            if mh:
                top = heapq.heappop(mh) + 1
                if top != 0:
                    memo[time+n].append(top)
             
            if time in memo:
                for new in memo[time]:
                    heapq.heappush(mh, new)
                del memo[time]
        return time
            
```

### Queue Version

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        
        counts = Counter(tasks)
        
        mh = [-count for count in counts.values()]
        heapq.heapify(mh)
        
        q = deque()
        time = 0
        
        while mh or q:
            time += 1
            
            if mh:
                top = heapq.heappop(mh) + 1
                if top != 0:
                    q.append([time+n, top])
                    
            if q and q[0][0] == time:
                _, value = q.popleft()
                heapq.heappush(mh, value)
        return time
            
```
